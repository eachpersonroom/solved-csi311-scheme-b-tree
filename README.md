As discussed in class, rewrite the B-Trees from earlier in the semester in Scheme. Use only Scheme information found in the slides – <strong><u>functions other than those defined in the slides are not allowed</u></strong>. Recursion will be critical for this assignment.

Below please find a sample tree. Note that it is a different tree from the Java sample.




(define tree ‘ ( “R” 100 999

(

(“R” 100 199

(

(“L” 120 140 160 180)

)

)

(“R” 200 299

(

(“L” 220 240 260 280)

)

)

)  )  )




(define (search tree value)

)
